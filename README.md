## Install

```

**Warning:** This package is native [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and no longer provides a CommonJS export. If your project uses CommonJS, you will have to [convert to ESM](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) or use the [dynamic `import()`](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import) function. Please don't open issues for questions regarding CommonJS / ESM.

## Usage

```typescript
import { airports, fares, flights } from '@2bad/ryanair'

// Get information about the closest airport based on your IP address
const airport = await airports.getClosest()

// Get a list of available dates from a specific destination
const dates = await flights.getDates('BER', 'DUB')

// Or the cheapest one-way fares between two airports for a given start date
const cheapest = await fares.cheapestPerDay('BER', 'DUB', '2023-10-10')
```
